# BASIC ML

Repository holds a library of most common algorithms used manually without using the help of <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank">`sklearn`</a> or other Machine Learning libraries.
Only used libraries are:
>    - <a href="https://numpy.org/" target="_blank">`numpy`</a>

which can be installed via
> `pip install numpy`

## Functionalities that are already implemented (state of 12.08.2020):
    - Linear Regression (with single- and multi-dimensional data support) <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html" target="_blank">`numpy`</a>

## Usage:
In general all classes and functions can be used exactly as those which are implemented in <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank">`sklearn`</a> with a `training` and a `predict` function. `score` functionality will be added later.
Algorithms that work exactly as describe above:
    - Linear Regression
Algorithms with different work-wise:
